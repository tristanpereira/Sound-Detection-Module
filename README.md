# Sound-Detection-Module
A simple circuit that uses an electret microphone to detect sound and output an analog signal. 
Uses a non-inverting Op-amp circuit to amplify the voltage from the electret mic such that it can be read by microcontrollers such as a 
Raspberry Pi or Arduino. 

This repository contains the schematic and pcb files for the circuit.
